This project's aim was to produce an export file with the calculated amount of bananas which are available on the day of this exercise. However, this project is created in such a way that you can also easily retrieve the calculated amounts of other types of fruits. 

In order to calculate the amounts, this project uses the following two files which can be found in src/main/groovy/resources:

- Input file: FruitExport_20220601.json
- Helper file: FruitColorMap.json

The export file of the calculated amount of bananas can be found in the following directory: src/output

The tests for this project reside in src/test and cover primarily the public functions of the helper classes.
